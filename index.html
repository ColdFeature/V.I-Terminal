<h2><span>&raquo;Report A24-1</span></h2>
<p>Date: 20th February 2026</p>
<p>Subject: SPECIMEN 2.4</p>

<p>Field Team Leader,</p>

<p>Specimen 2.4 was last documented during the Alpheros-Class Security Anomaly; responsible for the anarchy that ensued, namely the escape of all Novaraptors in captivity. With incredible foresight, coordination and collaboration Specimen 2.4 has successfully evaded our grasp and has eluded us ever since.</p>

<p>Alpheros - a cataclysm that has gone without any form of accountability or liability for any parties involved. I refuse to believe that it was the mere deception of an animal that we created. It simply could not have occurred without inside intervention - which as we have established prior is not something unheard of.</p>

<p>In any case: the few observations made with reference to Specimen 2.4 suggest atypical intellect, strength and 'influence'. Of course, studies have made evident the existence of 'alphas' in a pack of Novaraptors - but a leader of the entire species seems outright unrealistic. So, it is my firm and unfaltering belief that we must track down and subdue Specimen 2.4 "Ruvik" for meticulous study and scrutiny, good luck.</p>

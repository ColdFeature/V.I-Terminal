<h2><span>&raquo;Island Archive</span></h2>
<p>Last Edited: 2/11/1997</p>
<p>Designation: 1</p>

<p>Name: Primis</p>

<p>Biodiversity: Low</p>

<p>Radiation: Low; Effects minimal.</p>

<p>Volcanic Activity: Average</p>
	
<p>Seismic Activity: Low</p>
	
<p>Active Stations: 6</p>
	
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Primis is one of the two publicized islands that have gained a reputation for being a "lost world" of sorts, as for the other five islands, they have been cleared from all satellite imagery on behalf of Vera. This doesn't mean the owners of the satellites don't attempt to see what's happening on these islands, so most of our major facilities are housed underground or underwater where we can work in upmost secrecy. There hasn't been any trespassers since the 2003 incident luckily, but there has been a bit of questioning from the general public as to what happened to the individuals involved. Vera has put out an official statement about the issue that successfully swayed the public opinion to believe activity on the islands to be mining and crude oil gathering. Which just so happens to actually be the case with Prima Insula as it is one of the smaller islands, and since the environment and anomalous life here isn't as exotic as the remaining islands, our activity here is to be kept at a minimum.</p>

<p>Extra Notes:</p>
<p>Primis may seem mundane in comparison to our other...extraordinary assets, but in its defense it seems that we have made one of the most pivotal technological jumps in human history here and it involves...algae. Not just any algae, either. The algae here have been mutated just like any other organism born within the archipelago, and we've discovered that we can use the energy they absorb from both the sun and the radiant energy to create biopholtaic power. A single algae-filled lake here can run an entire facility for up to 3 years without shortage. Prof. Packardt has theorized we could create some sort of exo-suit that only uses the sun to charge. Of course we could've done it before now through many periods of trial and error, but the algae makes it all child's play.</p>
